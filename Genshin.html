					<h3>Yelan</h3>
					<p>Yelan is said to be quite secretive and mysterious; while claiming to work for the Ministry of Civil Affairs, she's frequently absent from work most of the year. Despite this, Ningguang tolerates her general absence while Keqing appreciates her work, although the latter wonders as to where she gets her intelligence from. She employs psychological tactics to catch her targets and get all the information she needs from them.<p>

					<h2>Raiden Shogun<h2>
				  </div>		
				</div>
				<div class="col-1-2">
					<h3>Raiden Shogun</h3>
					<p>The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity — a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.<p>
					<p>The Raiden Shogun is unique as she is comprised of two beings in one body: Ei, the current Electro Archon of Inazuma; and the Shogun, the puppet created by Ei to act as the ruler of Inazuma in her stead, which also serves as her vessel.<p>
				</div>

			<div class="container clearfix">
				<div class="col-1-2">
					<h3>Eula Lawrence</h3>
					<p>Eula is a descendant of Mondstadt's old aristocracy, being from the now-overthrown Lawrence Clan infamous for their tyrannical rule over Mondstadt. She dislikes people who view her similarly to the rest of her clan due to this mistrust, which has not been forgotten. She has a habit of declaring and getting "vengeance" against her enemies to redeem her family name. </p>
					<p>Eula severed her ties with the clan and became the captain of the Reconnaissance Company with the Knights of Favonius.</p>

					<h2>Kamisato Ayaka<h2>
				  </div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-1-2">
					<h3>Kamisato Ayaka</h3>
					<p>Ayaka is a kind-hearted girl with a pleasant temperament who treats others with politeness and courtesy. She holds the people of Inazuma dear to her heart and often goes out of her way to personally assist in all kinds of matters; being a member of the Yashiro Commission, she feels that she must meet the people's needs. Her dedication often moves people, and those close to her gave her the honorary title of Shirasagi Himegimi (Japanese: 白しら鷺さぎの 姫ひめ君ぎみ Shirasagi no Himegimi, "White Heron Princess"). People in the neighborhood always talk about her with sincere admiration.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="container clearfix">
				<div class="col-1-2">
					<h3>Hu Tao</h3>
					<p>At first glance, Hu Tao appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. She enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing, as she wishes to live her life to the fullest. Her eccentric and off-the-wall personality often leaves people with a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who states that she has a "punchable face" and should be stored in the fridge. In contrast, Xiao enjoys her sense of humor, finding it irritating but interesting.</p>
